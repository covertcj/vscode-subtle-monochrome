Subtle Monochrome for VS Code
=============================

A simple color theme that highlight only 'critical' areas of the code. This is
mostly an expirement by me, and currently only attempts to highlight strings
and comments.  Otherwise, the text is all a single color.

NOTE: This is a big work in progress (and the dark theme is essentially useless
for now).
